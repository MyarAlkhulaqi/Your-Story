<h1>You chose to continue focusing on your career! This choice leads you to expand the company abroad. You are gaining a lot in wealth but you feel like you're missing something more in life. You continue this lavish lifestyle until one day you at your base in NYC, you come across an old colleague from your old wrestling days. You two become nostalgic and while reminiscing, you start remembering how much you loved wrestling. Do you go back and start wrestling again? Or do you just move on? </h1>
